## 📖 Project Overview

Lab assignment-1 focuses on fundamental image processing tasks using Python. The objectives of Lab assignment-1 are: 

- **Task 1**: Extracts a 100×100 pixel region from the center of an image loaded from a URL.
- **Task 2**: Converts the image to the HSV color space and visualizes each component (Hue, Saturation, Value) in grayscale.

The implementation is done using Python and popular libraries like OpenCV, Matplotlib, and NumPy.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python libraries:
  - `opencv-python`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `numpy`

## 🚀 Installation
git clone https://github.com/ahmed010tanvir/Digital_Image_Processing_Lab.git

## 🎯 Usage 
**For Lab Assignment-1** 
---
Run the script in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or a local Python IDE).

Below are the steps: 

- Step 1: Load the Image 

  The script fetches an image from a URL and processes it. You can modify the image_url variable to use a different image.

- Step 2: Extract the Region
  
  The script extracts a 100×100 pixel region from the center of the image.

- Step 3: Convert to HSV
  
  The script converts the image to the HSV color space and displays the Hue, Saturation, and Value components in grayscale.
