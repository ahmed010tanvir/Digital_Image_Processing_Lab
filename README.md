## üìñ Project Overview

Lab assignment-1 focuses on fundamental image processing tasks using Python. The objectives of Lab assignment-1 are: 

- **Task 1**: Extracts a 100√ó100 pixel region from the center of an image loaded from a URL.
- **Task 2**: Converts the image to the HSV color space and visualizes each component (Hue, Saturation, Value) in grayscale.

Lab assignment-2 focuses on perform multiple transformation using Python. The objectives of Lab assignment-2 are:
- **Task 1**: Resize an image to 256x256 pixels.
- **Task 2**: Rotate by 180 degrees clockwise.
- **Task 3**: Apply a vertical flip.
- **Task 4**: Display all transformations in a single subplot.

The implementation is done using Python and popular libraries like OpenCV, Matplotlib, and NumPy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python libraries:
  - `opencv-python`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `numpy`

## üöÄ Installation
git clone https://github.com/ahmed010tanvir/Digital_Image_Processing_Lab.git

## üéØ Usage 
**For Lab Assignment-1** 
---
Run the script in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or a local Python IDE).

Below are the steps: 

- Step 1: Load the Image 

  The script fetches an image from a URL and processes it. You can modify the image_url variable to use a different image.

- Step 2: Extract the Region
  
  The script extracts a 100√ó100 pixel region from the center of the image.

- Step 3: Convert to HSV
  
  The script converts the image to the HSV color space and displays the Hue, Saturation, and Value components in grayscale.
  
**For Lab Assignment-2** 
---
- Step 1: Resize

  Resize the image to 256√ó256 pixels to ensure uniform dimensions.

- Step 2: Rotate

  Rotate the image by 180 degrees clockwise to flip it upside down.

- Step 3: Flip

  Apply a vertical flip to invert the image along the vertical axis.

- Step 4: Display

  Display all transformations in a single subplot for easy visualization
